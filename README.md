# Full-Stack Development Project: Exploring Node.js, Web Scraping, and React

Welcome to my project repository! This is a personal endeavor where I explore various aspects of full-stack development. I've set up this project to deepen my understanding and skills in several key areas of web development.

## Project Overview

This repository contains three distinct projects, each focusing on a different aspect of full-stack development:

- **Data Processing and Pipelining**: In the `data-processing` folder, I dive into handling large files using the Node Streams API and transforming CSV data into SQL commands utilizing Knex.
- **Web Scraping Exploration**: The `web-scraping` folder showcases my work with web scraping tools like Crawlee and Cheerio, exploring the intricacies of extracting data from web pages.
- **Frontend Development with React**: In the `frontend-react` folder, I focus on building interfaces using React and experiment with UI frameworks like Chakra UI.

Each project is self-contained, sharing some common NPM modules. The `package.json` in the parent folder lists these shared dependencies.

## Technical Skills and Tools

The projects cover various technologies and tools, including:

- TypeScript
- React
- SQL
- Node.js (version 18+)
- NPM

While working on these projects, I also got the chance to learn and incorporate new tools and libraries, enhancing my adaptability and proficiency in full-stack development.

## Getting Started

To run these projects, ensure you have Node (version 18+) and NPM installed. You can install them from [Node.js official site](https://nodejs.org/en/download). Additionally, run the following command to install `tsx`, a tool for running TypeScript files:

```sh
npm install --global tsx
```

## Dependencies

The `package.json` file includes most of the necessary Node.js modules. Running `npm install` in the parent folder will set up the shared dependencies. I've also included some utility libraries like `lodash`, `immutable`, `dayjs`, and `axios`. Feel free to add more packages as needed!
