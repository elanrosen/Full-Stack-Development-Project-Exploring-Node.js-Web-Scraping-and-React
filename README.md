# Full-Stack Development Project: Node.js, Web Scraping, and React

Welcome to my comprehensive repository where I delve into the multifaceted world of full-stack development. This initiative is a testament to my commitment to mastering web development technologies, with each project serving as a unique exploration into different facets of this domain.

## Project Overview

Contained within are three distinct projects, each a deep dive into a crucial aspect of full-stack development:

- **Data Processing and Pipelining**: Located in `data-processing`, this section is a deep dive into handling massive datasets. Here, I employ the Node Streams API for efficient large file management, transforming CSV data into SQL commands with the help of Knex.

- **Web Scraping Exploration**: In `web-scraping`, I showcase my proficiency in extracting data from web pages using advanced web scraping tools like Crawlee and Cheerio, emphasizing data extraction and manipulation.

- **Frontend Development with React**: The `frontend-react` directory is a demonstration of my skills in creating responsive user interfaces using React, complemented by UI frameworks like Chakra UI. The section features a live application, the [Domain Shopping Cart](https://main.d3dvm7vdkjxj45.amplifyapp.com/), which exemplifies practical application deployment.

Each of these projects operates independently but shares certain NPM modules. The root `package.json` outlines these shared dependencies.

## Technical Skills and Tools

This repository is a reflection of my journey through various technologies and tools in the full-stack landscape:

- TypeScript
- React
- Chakra UI
- Crawlee
- SQLite
- Node.js (version 18+)
- NPM
- AWS Amplify

## Getting Started

To engage with these projects, ensure you have Node (version 18+) and NPM installed. Download them from the [Node.js official site](https://nodejs.org/en/download). Additionally, for TypeScript file execution, install `tsx`:

```sh
npm install --global tsx
```

## Dependencies

Run `npm install` in the root directory to install essential Node.js modules as outlined in the `package.json` file. This setup includes utility libraries like `lodash`, `immutable`, `dayjs`, and `axios`, with the option to integrate additional packages as required.
